## Electricity
To do any project in electronics it is helpful to understand at least the basics of electricity.  There is considerably more to the topic here but in order to keep this project as direct as possible we'll only cover parts required to understand **and** complete this project.

#### Current

An old and popular analogy used for explaining electricity is water through a garden hose.  However for this lesson we'll use the idea of a car on a road.  How fast the car goes down the road is the *current* which is measured in miles per hour (mph).  
The electrical equivalent to this is measuring the amount of current in *amps*.  

#### Resistance
To continue with our car analogy, we need to make sure our car isn't traveling too fast when going around a corner.  In order to do this we apply the brakes to slow down the car in order to safely drive on the road.  In electricity we apply *resistance* which is measured in *ohms*.  The more resistance, the higher the ohms.  We want to do this to make sure we don't burn out any electronics, just as we apply the brakes to prevent a car crash.  In we don't apply enough resistance too much current will flow causing items to get to hot or even catch fire.

## Common Electronics
There are many pieces to an even a starter electronics kit.  For this project we'll only be covering the types used in the project.  Future projects will use more advanced components and will explain those in more detail.

#### Resistor

The resistor is how we apply resistance as noted by the Resistance section noted above.  Resistors are color coded to indicate how much resistance is applied.
