## Introduction
This project came about as a way to help students of all ages work on a basic electronics project.  The project implemented by the end of the lessons will be a fully functional weather station with optional ideas for further extending the lessons.

The approach used for this project is project based learning.  This amounts to breaking up the tasks for students into smaller pieces with deliverables along the way.

## Lessons
#### [Electricity/Electronics](electricity.md)  
 Learn the basics of electricity and some of the components we'll use through this project

#### [The Weather Station Hardware](hardware.md)  
* Choosing A [Board](hardware.md)  
 Various System on a Chip (SoC) options are available.
* Collect Other [Components](hardware.md)  
 We'll want to gather all of our components to start with so we have them available.
* [Assembling](assembly.md) The Components  
 Learn how to wire up the components.

#### The Weather Station Software  
* [Collecting Weather Data](software.md)  
What do we do with the data from our new device.
* 3rd Party Software  
Instead of building our own, what open source weather software options are available?
