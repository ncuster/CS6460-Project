## Introduction
This project came about as a way to help students of all ages work on a basic electronics project.  The project implemented by the end of the lessons will be a fully functional weather station with optional ideas for further extending the lessons.

The approach used for this project is project based learning.  This amounts to breaking up the tasks for students into smaller pieces with deliverables along the way.

## Lessons
### Electricity/Electronics
