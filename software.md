## Software

Now that we have built our weather station, we need to decide how to look at the data it is collecting.  The two options considered here are viewing on a computer in plain text, or uploading to Weather Underground.  Unfortunately after I started this project Weather Underground has removed free access to their API.  They are working on a new more limited solution, but as of this writing in late 2018 that new solution is not available.

#### Text Output
We'll use the following code tutorial on how to write a basic program to output what the Raspberry Pi has found in terms of weather data collection.  We'll use a popular and fairly easy to learn programming language called Python.

#### Python
TODO:  write the basic python tutorial (just enough to understand how it talks to the board)
